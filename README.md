Why would I want to backup my save?
Lots of reasons. Maybe you need to reformat your computer. Maybe the game crashes often
and you want a backup in case it crashes while saving, corrupting your save. Whatever
your reason, you can use this tool to easily backup and restore your MHW save.

This will generate a .bat file which will back up your Monster Hunter World save file to
a directory of your choosing. It will generate a new backup every time you run the
output .bat file and the directory will be timestamped like this:

2018-08-20 13.53.08

This example backup was made on August 20, 2018 at 8 seconds past 1:53 PM.

In this directory will be a .bat file called "restore.bat". Run this file to restore the
backup from this directory.

Warning: Do not backup or restore while Monster Hunter World is running! Doing so could
corrupt your save! I'm not responsible if something goes wrong!
